A interesting project used to solve Sudoku problems.

## Description
* Sudoku problem should be given in numpy array format.
* `Sudoku_while` solution provides one possible solution for a Sudoku problem.
* `Sudoku` solution can give multiple solutions for a Sudoku problem.

### TBD
* Keep unique solutions in `Sudoku.py`, currently may have duplicate solustions.
* Future development, use camera to capture a picture, then utilise Machine Learning techniques to identify the image, solve the problem.
